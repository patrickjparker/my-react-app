            "Question": "Do I need to be a BYU student to skate?",

Students may purchase additional tickets to bring adult guests. All participants must be 18 and older, with the exception of current BYU students under the age of 18."

As skaters turn in their skates to leave the event, additional skate spots will open. Once capacity is reached we cannot guarantee if or when spots will open, but will do our best to accommodate all interested participants as quickly as possible."

          {
            "Question": "Why are tickets sold by time slots?",
            "Answer": "Because so many students attend this event, the best way for us to provide everyone a fair opportunity to ice skate is to give each person a designated time slot of skate time. However, students have access to all other event offerings throughout the night. Time slots apply only to ice skating."

            "Answer": "Yes! We will have a shuttle service from 7:45pm-12:15am the night of the event. Students should line up near the East roundabout of the Wilkinson Student Center. The shuttle will run to and from Peaks Ice Arena for the night. Shuttles do not have exact depart/arrival times as they simply run continuous loops based on student need, but departure times from each location will be no more than 15 minutes apart."

Can these myths do the same thing for us today? While narratives from Greek and Roman culture have sometimes been used to bolster negative ideologies, such as misogyny, racism, and cultural chauvinism, the vibrancy of these stories keeps them from being tied to any single meaning. Rereading and retelling Greek and Roman myths through a social justice lens can help us preserve important aspects of our cultural heritage, while also transforming our current culture for the better.",

At the same time, most teenage girls did not self-identify as feminists, and many criticized the movement for “going too far.” Drawing on early 1970s oral history interviews with girls from across the nation, this presentation will consider how girls coming of age during a time of gender contestation situated themselves culturally and politically. Faced with multiple and contradictory meanings for girlhood, many girls tried to find some kind of middle ground: to assert new rights for gender equality while protecting their sense of the entitlements of femininity.",
